# Install

There are two options to install this package to your Linux box:

1. Install as a user to install the commands to the user bin
    folder in your home path.
2. Install as `root` to install the commands globally.

Navigate to the package bin directory and execute the install-cmd script.
This will install symbolic links to the apropriate bin folder, either
~/bin for a user or /usr/local/bin for root user.
